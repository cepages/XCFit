# XCFit : Xcode 8 + Swift 3

#### XCFit a.k.a ([XCUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/406/0), [Cucumberish](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish) and [Fitnesse](https://github.com/paulstringer/OCSlimProject) Integrations Tests) is a full stack Xcode BDD framework for [Swift](https://swift.org) iOS and macOS apps. XCFit allows us to write API, UI and Acceptance Tests with Swift in human readable language using tools like [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) in Xcode. We can still use Apple's brand new UI Testing framework (XCUI) under the hood of Cucumberish. XCFit is fully automated solution for Cucumberish and Fitnesse. You can use 80(Fitnesse):20(Cucumberish) formula to automate Acceptance and UI Testing for better coverage and faster feedback. XCFit is available on [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/xcfit) and [CocoaPods](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/XCFit).

### XCFit Features
***
  -  You can now write Given When Then and Decision Table in Xcode !! YAY.. Thanks to Cucumberish and OCSlimProject ! And XCFit automated them !!
  -  You can now write/Execute all your Acdeptance Tests and UI Tests using Apple's brand new programming language "Swift" in Xcode. Goodbye Appium, Calabash, Frank, KIF and Goodbye Ruby,Java, Python. It's pure Swift !!
  -  XCFit provides Xcode Templates to create new Cucumberish and Fitnesse targets which reduce hectic Xcode configuration steps. It's all automated in XCFit
  -  One command to set all fully automated Xcode template for Cucumberish and Fitnesse targets
  - New Template to create Gherkin Feature file in Xcode
  - Automated [Cucumberish](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish) Setup in one command
  - Enhanced [OCSlimProject](https://github.com/paulstringer/OCSlimProject) templates and automated Fitnesse download process.
  - XCFit target templates are independent of native Xcode Test targets.
  - We can stiil use Apple's brand new XCUI Testing framework. Its native Xcode implementation, No Appium, Calabash etc etc
  - Setup Cucumberish and Fitnesse in Xcode within few minutes !!

Big Thanks to
  - [Cucumberish](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish) : Provide native [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) parser for iOS Apps to enable BDD in Xcode using Given When Then. Yay!
  - [OCSlimProject](https://github.com/paulstringer/OCSlimProject) : Provide Xcode Templates to enable BDD with Decision Tables using Fitnesse

XCFit automated configuration of these two guys.

### Version
CocoaPods -- [XCFit-CocoaPods](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/XCFit) : 0.1.0

RubyGems  -- [xcfit-RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/xcfit)  : 2.0.1

### Tech & Software Requirements

XCFit uses a number of open source projects to work properly. You need to have following

Hardware : You must have Mac Operating System with OSX/MacOS version > 10.9

Software:
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) for GEM management. Ideally Ruby > 2.X
* [Xcode8](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Ideally Xcode 8
* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) - RubyGem with [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed
* [Curl on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/curl.1.html) - Might be pre-installed but worth double checking.
* NodeJS and iOS-Sim
* Ruby Packages : Xcpretty, Fastlane(Optional), Rake, Bundler.. Install with 'gem install <package_name>'


### Installation

XCFit requires [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) to run.

You need Gulp installed globally:


      $ gem install xcfit

Now you are good to get started with XCFit for now. Later we also need to install XCFit Pod.

# Usage
Now that you can execute 'xcfit' command from your terminal/iTerm etc etc. Example Output Looks like this :

```
$ xcfit
Tasks:
  xcfit get_cucumberish VERSION  # Downloads Cucumberish version and Create Features directory. You must execute this from Cucumberish Xcode Target directory
  xcfit get_fitnesse             # Download Fitnesse JAR file from Internet. You must execute this from Xcode Fitnesse Acceptance Test Xcode Target directory
  xcfit help [TASK]              # Describe available tasks or one specific task
  xcfit set_xcode_templates      # Generate All Xcode Templates for the Gherkin Feature Files & targets for Cucumberish and Fitnesse
  xcfit version                  # Get the current version number

```

## Setup Xcode Templates

In existing app or brand new app, we have to enable the Xcode templates for files and targets to speed up the things. Run following command from your terminal


```sh
$ xcfit set_xcode_templates

```

-  This will add couple of templates to your Xcode for iOS and macOS apps. In your app if you go to 'File--->New--->Target'

You will see new option for iOS and OSX i.e 'XCFit'. Once Clicked on it. You will see Cucumberish UI and Fitnesse Acceptance Tests targets. As shown

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/new_targets_xcode8.png)

- Once Clicked on the target e.g 'Cucumberish UI Test Bundle' Xcode will create UI testing target with all the required files with Bridging hrader for Cucumberish UI Testing.
Once Clicked on the target e.g 'Fitnesse Acceptance Test Bundle' Xcode will create UI tAcceptance test with all the required files with Bridging headers for the Fitnesse Acceptance Test. We will see that in details soon.

- This script also set new file type in Xcode to create new Gherking feature file

## Setting up Cucumberish UI Target

Few Steps to setup BDD Styles in Xcode8

##### Add New Target for Cucumberish

- Add new target iOS/macOS project and Select "File -> New -> Target -> XCFit -> Cucumberish UI Test Bundle". Give it a name you like e.g CucumberishUITests

Now that Xcode has created brand new target with all required Swift and Objective-C files to run Cucumberish. All Xcode setting has been done by the Xcode Template.
####### Link Target Application
The most important thing is link your target to application to test. Cucumberish target 'General' setting select 'Testing -> Target To Test' and configure scheme to add Cucumeerish UI target to Test

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/LinkTargetTestApp.png)

#### Cucumberish Page Object Pattern Directory Structure

Now that, you can observe that new target has nice directory structure following [Page Object Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html)

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/DirectoryStructure.png)

#####  Download Cucumberish in the target

This can be done in two ways. By directly downloading contents of "Cucumberish" directory into the target directory or using Cocoapods.
######  Using Direct Download with XCFit
- Now that you have to CD into the Cucumberish target directory .eg CucumberishUITests

```sh
$ cd $_YOUR_CUCUMBERISH_TARGET_DIR
$ xcfit get_cucumberish 1.0.0
```
This will download Cucumberish directory from version 1.0.0 and also create 'Features' directory. You can then reference those directory in Xcode. For "Cucumberish" directory select 'Copy if needed and Create Group' and for the "Features" directory select don't create group or Copy if needed. Just " create folder reference"

######  Using Cocoapods

- In your Podfile, add following Pod entry and update/install pod

```ruby
    target '$_YOUR_CUCUMBERISH_TARGET' do
      pod 'Cucumberish', :git => 'https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish'
    end
```



```sh
$ pod update
```


#####  Create Cucumber Features - Gherkin
Now Add sample Feature File to 'Features' directory either by File->New->Gherkin Or Just add it using your favourite text editor e.g demo.feature with content

```
Feature: Demo App Feature

Scenario: Demo Scenario

Given the app is running

```

##### Add Target To Test

- Finally, Run Your Test from Cucumberish Target by Pressing 'CMD+U'

You are done !!

Look how easy it is !

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/POM_Cucumberish.gif)


You can add more feature/Scenarios and implement steps definitions inside your Swift File. [Ahmed-Ali](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali) creator of Cucumberish already implemented useful pre-defined steps have a look at this [Swift file](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish/blob/master/CucumberishExample/CucumberishExampleUITests/CCIStepDefinitions.swift). You are free to try Page Object Pattern and all other crazy stuff to abstract and refactor your Swift code.

##### Error: Use Legacy Swift Language Version” (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax…] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.

If you get this error when you build your target, it's really easy to fix.

Select your Cucumberish testing target -> Select the Build Settings Tab -> Search for `Use legacy Swift Language Version` and select the option `No`

With this we are telling to XCode that the testing code will be in Swift 3.0.

![use legacy swift language version screen shot example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5259830/20247607/2f47df4a-a9c8-11e6-9454-c31ab8f0d546.png)

## Setting up Fitnesse Acceptance Target with XCTest

You can also setup Fitnesse Acceptance Tests but you need to use Cocoapods for this target.

You can find detailed blog post on [Dzone](https://dzone.com/articles/integrate-fitnesse-with-xctest-using-xcode8)

#### Add Acceptance and Acceptance Unit Test Target to Project

We have all the predefined targets for FitNesse. Just add “Acceptance Tests” target from the template and “AcceptanceUnitTests” target from the bundle. You will need “FitNesse Suite page name” to create this target but just put “OCSlimProjectExamplePage” there for now . Add your ‘AcceptanceTests’ target as a ‘Target Dependancy’ of this new target in Build Phases. This ensures that it the latest code has been built prior to the tests being run.

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/targets.gif)

#### Add Pod Dependencies
We need to create a “Podfile” at the root of the project with the following content.

```ruby
target 'AcceptanceTests' do     
   pod 'OCSlimProject'
end   
target 'AcceptanceUnitTests' do     
   pod 'OCSlimProjectTestBundleSupport'
end
```

Now, we can run ‘pod install’ at this stage and close the current Xcode session and open project workspace.

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/pod_install.gif)

#### Build Acceptance Tests Target
At this stage, we should be able to build the “Acceptance Tests” target. If you are using Xcode8, you might see some warning related to the Swift3 Syntax. Just Click on ‘Edit-> Convert-> To Current Swift Syntax

Now you should be able to build an “Acceptance Tests” target. Once, build is successful, you should see “LaunchFitnesse” script is generated in the root of the project. We can launch and execute the fitness test as shown below.

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/build_acceptace.gif)

#### Test AcceptanceUnitTests Target

Now if you select “AcceptanceUnitTarget” and press CMD+U.

![image](https://github.com/Shashikant86/XCFit-GIFS/blob/master/RunXCUITest.gif)


Now we can see that FitNesse tests are running as shown above.  We can add this to main scheme to make sure we are running it after the unit tests to follow proper development workflow. We can build and run it as our normal unit tests.


### Taking Control with Bundler, Fastlane, and Trainer

Now that , we have seen how to run FitNesse acceptance tests from Xcode but it’s a good idea to run it with Fastlane.  We can also take control of version of Cocoapods and Fastlane by using Bundler. Let’s create a Gemfile at the root of the project with the following gem

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"   
gem 'cocoapods'
gem 'fastlane'   plugins_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '.', 'Pluginfile') eval(File.read(plugins_path), binding) if File.exist?(plugins_path
```

Let’s also create directory “fastlane” and make “Fastfile” with following content

```ruby

fastlane_version "1.104.0"  
default_platform :ios   
platform :ios do   
before_all do     
   system "rm -rf ../test_reports/"     
   system "bundle install"     
   system "pod install"     
    system "bundle exec fastlane add_plugin trainer"   
end     
desc "Runs all the Unit tests and Fitnesse Aceptance Tests"   
lane :xctest_fitnesse do    
  scan(scheme: "FitnesseXCTestDemo",
   destination: 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 7 Plus,OS=10.0',  
   output_directory: "test_reports/",    
    output_types: "html",    
    fail_build: false    )
   trainer(output_directory: "test_reports/trainer_report/")   
end
end
```

Now we will create a “fastlane/PluginFile” to add “trainer” plugin.

```ruby
 gem 'fastlane-plugin-trainer'

```

After running “bundle install” we should be able to run those test from command line like this :
